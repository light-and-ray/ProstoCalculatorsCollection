A little internet musem of calculating devices
It is not an almanac, here I post only what I have. For almanac I recommend <u>[casio.ledudu.com](https://casio.ledudu.com/pockets.asp?menu=1&lg=eng)</u> (Casios only)


<u>[GitHub repository](https://github.com/light-and-ray/ProstoCalculatorsCollection)</u> of this website\
Yes, it is written on bash which generates markdown\
