A little internet musem of calculating devices
It is not an almanac, here I post only what I have. For almanac I recommend _[casio.ledudu.com](https://casio.ledudu.com/pockets.asp?menu=1&lg=eng)_ (Casios only)


_[GitHub repository](https://github.com/light-and-ray/ProstoCalculatorsCollection)_ of this website\
Yes, it is written on bash which generates markdown\
